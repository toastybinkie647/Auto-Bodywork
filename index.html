         	<h2>Why do it DIY?</h2>
            <p>Respraying your car yourself (DIY) offers several advantages compared to hiring professionals. One of the biggest benefits is cost savings. By doing it yourself, you eliminate labour costs, which make up a significant portion of professional services. You only need to pay for materials like paint, primer, sandpaper, and tools, which can cost significantly less than a professional respray. Additionally, you have control over material costs, allowing you to buy only what you need and avoid unnecessary expenses.<br>
			<br>
            Another advantage is the sense of personal satisfaction and creativity that comes with completing the project yourself. Respraying your car can be a rewarding experience, giving you a sense of accomplishment once the job is done. It also allows for customization—you can experiment with colours, finishes, or designs without being limited by professional constraints. On top of that, it’s a valuable learning opportunity that helps you develop new skills and gain insight into car maintenance..</p>

                                <p>This stage will cover several important preparation steps you need to complete before painting your car. Proper preparation is essential to ensure a smooth, long-lasting finish.

Taking the time to do this prep work carefully will help the paint adhere properly and result in a more professional-looking final outcome. </p>

                                <p>This stage is crucial, as it's the foundation for the color you're planning to apply to the car. The priming process doesn’t just involve spraying the base coat — it also includes block sanding and tarp preparation to ensure a mess-free, smooth finish for the final paint. Any flaws or imperfections at this stage will become even more noticeable once the new color goes on, potentially leading to a disappointing result.</p>
