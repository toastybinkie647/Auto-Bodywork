            <p>Before moving on to this step, it’s crucial that all dents and body panels are properly fixed and repaired. Ensure that the body filler is sanded completely flush with the surface of the car, leaving no uneven spots. It's also important to sand the entire body to a matte finish before applying the first coat of paint. While these tasks may feel time-consuming and even a bit tedious, they are essential in preventing costly mistakes down the line. Taking the extra time to ensure the surface is smooth and properly prepped will help avoid issues like paint peeling and ensure a flawless finish. You also want to cover the whole car in plasics so that you dont get over spray in areas you dont want, for example, tape of the inside of the car so that no paint can get inside.</p>

                                <p> While painting the first coat onto the car, also known as the dust coat. You do not want to get a full layer of paint onto the car, this step allows for more foundation for the heavier coats that come along. in this step you just want to apply a light coat, let it dry then you are ready for the first layer of paint. with painting a car you always start with the inside of the doors and work outwards, this is beacuse while painting the inside you will get over spray on the outside of the car.</p>

                                <h2>Heavy Layers.</h2>
                                <p>At this stage, you want to apply thick, heavy layers of primer to the car. Because primer is thicker than the final color or clear coat, it’s much less likely to run, although it’s still possible. Be sure to cover every surface, paying extra attention to exposed edges, as these areas are most vulnerable to paint peeling and rust. The number of primer layers you apply will depend on the car’s condition. If you notice defects through the first two coats, it’s a good idea to block sand the surface lightly before proceeding with additional coats. This will help refine the smoothness and shape of the car over time. Remember, the key to improving your painting skills is practice and learning from your mistakes.</p>

                                <p>This phase of respraying your car can feel like the most frustrating and time-consuming part of the process. It often feels like there's little visual progress, even though it takes the longest, which can be demotivating. However, the more time you invest in perfecting the primer coat, the better your final finish will turn out. This stage is all about setting your own standards and achieving the exact finish you envision. In this phase you want to look for any matte spots, bumps or divots, and you want to try to sand it down, and if you get to metal again you respray and continue the process till completed</p>
