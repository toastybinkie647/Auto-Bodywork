         	<h2>Why is this stage important?</h2>
            <p>This stage is the base level preperation that you need to do before you even start sanding you car. having a good setup will allow you to have a good work flow without any annoying issues, for example, losing your tools or misplacing them. having everything set in place before you begin is the biggest time saver, it might not feel like it when you are doing it. But when you make a mistake due to skipping this step you'll spend more time fixing and undoing yourmistakes.</p>

                                <p> To have a nice workflow and make respraying your car almost effortless having your workspace step up well and have all the equipment. This will help drastically. for the location you have choisen you want to make sure that all items surrounding the car are protected or out of harms way, and when it comes to painting the car make sure that you have either tarps or blakents to minimize paint overspray. If possible it would be a great help having boxes or bags that you can hold loose parts for the car, having these labeled will save a huge amount of time looking for parts that you need.</p>

                                <p>In this step you want to make sure to strip everything possible from the car, this can include lights, bumpers/extra body panels, doors, wheels, roof(if possible) and if you really want to be safe we recomend taking out the interirour. there are certain items that are car spasific, so we recomend looking at video guides or car forums to find a easy and save way to remove that piece, you also have to keep into condsideration what your standards are, you will have to deside if removing/adding things to your car will get effected by painting or not.</p>

                                <p>In the current world there is a lot of content that displays people resotoration of cars, although with a younger audiance people expect this job to be easy and fast. there are to many project cars that young adults have begun and under estimated the process and time. But the brutal truth is that this process is time costly and tring. depending on the cars condition it can take around 4 months - years, it all depends on what your standards are. although if you really enjoy working on a project you wont have a problem looking for time to work on it, even if it means asking for help. So to have a good time respraying your car you need to set realisic goals and expectaions for yourself, this will allow you to get the most out of this experiance.</p>
